============================

The 'hp' program implements a reverse polish notation calculator.
The original C port was created in 1985. This Git repo tracks the history
as best as I could reconstruct it. See the man page for more information.

hp.awk is a version written in portable awk, mostly for the fun of it.
It requires that each operand and operator be separated from the next
by whitespace.
